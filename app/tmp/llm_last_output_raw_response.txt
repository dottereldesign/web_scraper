Teachers, teacher aides, the administration and caretaker all contribute to what makes Pokeno School such a great place to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have a very supportive School Board.  They work hard behind the scenes ensuring the governance of the school is managed in a way that always puts the children first.
