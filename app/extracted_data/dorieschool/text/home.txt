Kia ora, Welcome
On behalf of the staff, students and the Dorie School Community, I wish to welcome you and your family to Dorie School and trust that your time with us will be a happy and productive experience.
​
We are a friendly, family orientated school catering for the needs of students in Years 1 – 8.      

At Dorie School we strive to develop students who are:

·      Life long learners

·      Confident creative thinkers, problem solvers and effective communicators

·      Respectful of themselves, others and the environment

·      Connected to their community and contribute in meaningful ways

We look forward to working positively with you and your child on their educational pathway.

Our “open door” policy means that we welcome your input, feedback and support. The teachers and I are always available to discuss any issues you may have. Please feel free to drop in for a coffee and a chat.

​Nga mihi nui

Donna Donnelly
